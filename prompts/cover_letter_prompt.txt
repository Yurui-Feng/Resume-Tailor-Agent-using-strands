> I’m applying for the following role:
> **[Paste full job posting here]**
>
> Here is my resume:
> **[Paste resume text here, or say “see attached PDF resume” if the tool supports file upload]**
>
> Please write a **1-page cover letter** tailored to this role with the following style and constraints:
>
> * **Tone:** straightforward, human, and modest. It should sound like something a real person would write in plain English, not like marketing copy or a research paper.
> * **Length & structure:**
>
>   * 3–4 short paragraphs.
>   * Each sentence should be clear and direct; avoid long, complex sentences.
> * **Content focus:**
>
>   * In the second paragraph, focus on my **most relevant recent role(s)** and connect my work to the job posting requirements.
>   * Mention my experience with **[add your key themes, e.g. “cloud, ML platforms, and generative AI applications”]** *only if* they clearly match the posting.
>   * Briefly summarize my education in **one short paragraph or sentence** (no GPA bragging or long lists).
> * **What to avoid:**
>
>   * Don’t use buzzwords like “cutting-edge,” “revolutionize,” “transformative,” “thrilled,” etc. Once or twice is okay, but keep it minimal.
>   * Don’t over-sell or exaggerate; keep claims grounded in what’s on my resume.
>   * Don’t repeat large chunks of the job description back to me.
> * **Formatting:**
>
>   * Start with “Dear Hiring Manager,” (or a specific name if it’s given in the posting).
>   * End with a simple closing like: “Thank you for considering my application.” followed by my name and basic contact info if needed.
>
> Before you give the final answer, quickly **mentally check** that:
>
> * The letter is specific to this role and company (mentions them by name).
> * The language feels simple, natural, and non-“AI-ish.”

### Optional “quick” follow-up prompt

Once you get a draft you like but it’s too wordy, you can use this on the *same* letter:

> Please rewrite this cover letter so it’s simpler and more human:
>
> * Keep all the important concrete details and examples.
> * Shorten sentences and remove filler phrases and buzzwords.
> * Aim for 3–4 short paragraphs max.
> * Keep the tone professional but relaxed, like a real person writing, not an AI.
