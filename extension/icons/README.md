# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Solution

For development and testing, you can use simple placeholder icons. Here are a few options:

### Option 1: Use Online Icon Generator
1. Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or similar
2. Upload a simple image or logo
3. Generate and download icons in required sizes

### Option 2: Create Simple Icons
Use any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop) to create simple squares with:
- Background color: #2f3543 (brutalist accent color)
- White "RT" text in the center (for Resume Tailor)
- Save as PNG in required sizes

### Option 3: Use Free Icon Resources
- Download from https://www.flaticon.com/ (search for "resume" or "document")
- Resize to required dimensions
- Ensure proper attribution if needed

## Important

Until you add real icons, Chrome will show a default gray puzzle piece icon. The extension will still function normally, but won't look as polished.

To test quickly, you can copy any 3 PNG files and rename them to icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png.
